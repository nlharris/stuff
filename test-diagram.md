# Experimenting with GitHub diagram creation
Example from https://github.com/orgs/linkml/discussions/1739#discussioncomment-8836361

Here is code for invoking mermaid in a markdown file; below that is the diagram that is rendered.

````markdown
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph schema_b
    subgraph prefixes
    sch_b[schema_a: URI]
    end
    subgraph imports
    sch_b_yaml[schema_a.yaml]
    end
    schema_a:Person
    end

    subgraph schema_a
    direction TB
    id
    Person
    id -- "expand" --Person
    end

    sch_b -- "match" --Person
    schema_a:Person -- "expand" --sch_b
    Person -- "retrieve" --sch_b_yaml
```
````

Diagram produced by that code:
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph schema_b
    subgraph prefixes
    sch_b[schema_a: URI]
    end
    subgraph imports
    sch_b_yaml[schema_a.yaml]
    end
    schema_a:Person
    end

    subgraph schema_a
    direction TB
    id
    Person
    id -- "expand" --> Person
    end

    sch_b -- "match" --> Person
    schema_a:Person -- "expand" --> sch_b
    Person -- "retrieve" --> sch_b_yaml
```

Here's a simpler example:
````markdown
```mermaid
 graph TD;
     A-->B;
     A-->C;
     B-->D;
     C-->D;
```
````

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

From @Harry:
I just learned that Mermaid will do Sankeys as well:

````markdown
```mermaid
---
config:
  sankey:
    showValues: false
---
sankey-beta

Bengal,Cat,92
Siamese,Cat,78
Maine Coon,Cat,105
Persian,Cat,67
Ragdoll,Cat,54
Domestic Shorthair,Cat,124
Siberian Husky,Dog,45
Golden Retriever,Dog,88
Labrador Retriever,Dog,97
German Shepherd,Dog,73
French Bulldog,Dog,32
Poodle,Dog,56
```
````

makes something like

and since GH will render Mermaid, release notes could include autogenerated Sankeys displaying the extent of changes, like
